 What happened? What happened after she got out of the orphanage?
 She found the old building where she used to live.
 And she went to sightseeing.
 And she started to have a look around.
 Um...
 What does she find in the building?
 These old pit pitches on the wall.
 And she found this old...
 ...so-so of my case thing.
 You forgot about the puppy?
 Um...
 After she was thrown out, a puppy came running.
 Um... a boy?
 Yeah.
 Do men?
 What were they doing?
 Do you remember?
 They were trying to find a laboratory to sort of audition.
 And they came here to pretend to be her.
 Yep.
 So they can get the money from the ground.
 That's a great story.
 Yeah.
 Where are we?
